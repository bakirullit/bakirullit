# Hi, I'm Bakdaulet Argyngazy 

**Cybersecurity Engineer & Software Developer** | Student at **Astana IT University (AITU)**  

I’m passionate about building **secure and efficient systems**, automating repetitive tasks, and exploring **how things work under the hood**. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple solutions—whether that’s analyzing networks, writing Python scripts, or designing backend systems.  

When I’m not coding, I experiment with **IoT projects** or dive into **Linux internals** to understand system behavior and security.

###  About Me
- I enjoy **learning by building** rather than just reading or watching tutorials.  
- I’m curious about **how systems fail** and how to prevent it.  
- I value **practical projects** that leave something behind for others to use or learn from.  
- Always exploring ways to **combine coding, security, and hardware** for innovative solutions.
